# Syntax comparison
Compare syntax of various programming languages.

## Goals
- Help you remember syntax of a language you haven't used in a while.
- If you know how to write something in one language, you should find
examples of how to write it in other languages here.
- Serve as a database for apps that compare syntax side by side.
